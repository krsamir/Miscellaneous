# Basics to Github
## (Most commonly Used Commands)

* `git init` : initialise repository
* `git status` : Shows status
* `git remote -verbose` or `git remote -v` : show active remote
* `git remote add <remoteName> <url> ` : Basically we are not going to use the long url everytime, So we use a remote name. Most commonly used remote name is **origin**.
* `git push -u <remoteName> <BranchName>` : here *-u* states to track the current branch. This syntax is used for first time and thereafter for pushing we just use `git push`.
